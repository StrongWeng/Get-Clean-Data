          # **From Original Data Sets To One Tidy Data**

explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

================================================================
As we are provided, the data sets containing subjects, activity names and measures on dimensions of activities (i.e. 561 dimensions)are divided separately into Test data set and Train data set.
We are asked to aggregate these separate data sets into a complete one by extracting only parts of variables we want.
I wrote scripts to generate it. The steps and scripts are as follows, describing the process how i read,subset,merge and transform these data sets into a complete one.
================================================================
# Step 1: Preparation
## First read in activity names and their measures we need 
## for merging purpose later, both for Test set and Train set.
variables=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt",sep="")
activity=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt",sep="")

#Step 2: Read in Test set data.
## Load the file of subjects_test, and rename column to "Subject".
## Load the file of X_test, and rename its columns with "variables" we prepared in step 1.
## Load the file of Y_test, and rename column to "Activity".
testsubject=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
                       ,sep="",col.names="Subject")
xtest=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt",sep=""
                 ,col.names=variables[,2])
ytest=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt",sep=""
                 ,col.names="Activity")
## Extract from "xtest"(i.e.561 dimensions of activities) only measures on mean or standard deviation for each variable. 
## Fetching variable name containing word of "mean" or "std" by grep function, we get a vector of integer column numbers. We then subset from "xtest" these columns with this criteria
meanvar1=grep("mean",names(xtest)); stdvar1=grep("std",names(xtest))
xtest1=xtest[,meanvar1]; xtest2=xtest[,stdvar1]
## Merge subjects,activity name codes and activity dimensions
## which are measures on mean or SD into one named "Test".
Test=cbind(testsubject,ytest,xtest1,xtest2)

# Step 3: Read in Train set data.
## Load the file of "subjects_train", and rename column to "Subject".
## Load the file of "X_train", and rename its columns with "variables" we prepared in step 1.
## Load the file of "Y_train"", and rename column to "Activity".
trainsubject=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt",sep="",col.names="Subject")
xtrain=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt",sep=""
                  ,col.names=variables[,2])
ytrain=read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt",sep=""
                  ,col.names="Activity")
## Extract from "xtrain"(i.e.561 dimensions of activities) only measures on mean or standard deviation for each variable. 
Fetching column names containing word of "mean" or "std" by grep function, we get a vector of integer column numbers. We then subset from "xtrain" these columns with this criteria
meanvar2=grep("mean",names(xtrain));stdvar2=grep("std"
                                                 ,names(xtrain))
xtrain1=xtrain[,meanvar2];xtrain2=xtrain[,stdvar2]
## Merge respondants,activity name codes and activity dimensions
## which are measures on mean or SD into one test set.
Train=cbind(trainsubject,ytrain,xtrain1,xtrain2)

## Merge test set and train set to form a complete data set.
TestTrain=rbind(Test,Train)
   

## Step 3:Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities
##       in the data set
TestTrain$Activity=factor(TestTrain$Activity,levels=activity[,1]
                          ,labels=activity[,2])
   
## Step 4:Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive 
## variable names. 
tobereplaced=tolower(names(TestTrain))
tobereplaced=gsub("\\.","",tobereplaced)
variables$lower=tolower(variables[,2])
variables$lower=gsub("-","",variables$lower)
variables$lower=sub("\\()","",variables$lower)
variables=variables[variables$lower%in%tobereplaced,]
variables$V2=as.character(variables$V2)
tobereplaced=c(c("Subject","Activity"),variables[,2])
colnames(TestTrain)=tobereplaced
## Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
## of each variable for each activity and each subject.
group=list(TestTrain$Subject,TestTrain$Activity)
tidydata=aggregate(TestTrain,group,mean)
tidydata$Subject=tidydata$Activity=NULL
colnames(tidydata)=tobereplaced
## Final step: write out the data generated by above procedure.
write.table(tidydata,file="tidydata.txt",row.names=F)
